      <span class="caps">I bet if</span> you ask any of your friends, whether they are in publishing or not, to name one magazine store in New York they will say <a href="https://www.instagram.com/casamagazinesnyc/">Casa Magazines</a>, in the West Village. It is a Tuesday morning on a cold February day, and I’m on West 12th street and 8th Avenue, looking at Casa Magazines from across the street. Ali, the store manager, is inside, getting all the new deliveries ready, and waiting for his clients to arrive. As you walk past this small store, you are already immersed in the world of magazines, with tens of issues displayed on its windows. And when you enter, you are welcomed by (literal) piles of publications. Thousands of magazines, from the iconic <span class="italic">Vogue Italia</span> to the most recent edition of <span class="italic">Cosmopolitan</span>, from the National Geographic magazine to the first issue of a new independent fashion publication. The new and the old coexist and flourish in this corner of New York City. “Everything is New York is modernised, but [Casa Magazine] is old school,” Ali tells me. “When people come to Casa [Magazines] they have flashback to many years ago, and they say to me: wow, this places still exists! Keep it up!”
      </p>

      <p>
      It is remarkable how a small store in the West Village was able to build such a big (and international) reputation. Founded in the 1970s, Casa Magazines has been selling magazines for over half a decade. Since the early 2000s, Ali is at the head of the store, and to him the success of the store lies in its selection and the community around it. And his customers seem to agree. “One of the reasons why I keep coming back, other than the excellent magazines selection, is Ali,” says Louis, who has been coming to Casa Magazines for around 18 years. Its success lies in the people who keep believing in it, and support it.

      <p>
      And the idea of supporting these small stores is very important. You don’t go to your local bookstore or magazine store to get the cheapest price, but to discover new publications through their selection, for the community around it, and because it is beautiful to get a chance to disconnect and be surrounded by publications. To support your favorite store is very important. But on this note, one question arises in my mind. What makes a customer buy a certain magazine?
      </p>

      <p>
      With the support of Ali, I interviewed 5 customers on that morning, and I asked them what attracted them to a specific publication. Each one of them had a different answers. Here’s what they said.</span>

        <h5>The Content</h5>
        <p>
        For Louis, who has been coming to Casa Magazines to buy the same magazines for eighteen years, it is the writing that counts. Louis is around 70 years old and has been living in New York for a long time. When I meet him, he’s buying one fashion magazine, and two architectural magazines.

        <h5>The Typography</h5>
        <p>
        For Giulia, who has been going to magazines stores “almost obsessively” every weekend for the past two years, it is the typography and the design that makes her buy a magazine. “As a designer, I like to look at magazines that look exciting to me.” Giulia is in her twenties and bought <span class="italic">Man About Town</span>.
      </p>

        <h5>The Cover</h5>
        <p>
        “It’s the cover. Aren’t magazines the one thing you judge by their cover?” Says Anna, an editor and a reader in her twenties. Anna doesn’t buy anything.
      </p>

        <h5>Photography</h5>
        <p>
        For Ali, who has been working at Casa Magazines for over two decades, it’s the content, especially the photography that makes a magazine interesting. He takes out the cats issue of the <span class="italic">National Geographic Magazine</span>. The photography is indeed very unique.
      </p>

        <h5>A Fresh Perspective</h5>
        <p>
        “I’m interested in something that brings a fresh perspective.” Sarah says. She is holding the <span class="italic">1 Granary magazine</span>. She is a college student at a famous fashion school.
