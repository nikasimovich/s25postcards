        <h5>Notes from January 29th, 2025</h5>
        <p>
       Today is Wednesday, January 29th, 2025 at the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park.
      </p>
      <p>
The weather is around 40 degrees Fahrenheit, windy, with sun peaking through the blanket of clouds covering the blue sky. 
        </p>
        The surrounding park is a palette of grays and browns, the trees’ leaves long gone. The pond where people usually row boats is frozen over. Geese cautiously walk around the icy terrain.  
        <p>
          <p>
            There are about 25 people in total, a stark difference to the typical crowd that summer, spring and autumn days bring. Some hold hands. There are are three people with cameras. Two people have type writers and are writing poetry. It is mostly quiet, but some people watch the geese and make honking sounds at them. An opera singer’s notes echo throughout the Bethesda Terrace. The wind slightly whistles through the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fountain is empty. There is no water. Yet people still come to look at it. No matter the weather -- rain, snow, or sun, people always visit this fountain.  The fountain almost shines in the rare rays of sun that peak out from this January day. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a permanence to it -- all of these people come and go, but the fountain remains.
          </p>
          Is the fountain ever alone? Where did it come from? Why is it here?
          <p>

        <h5>The Fountain’s Origins</h5>
        <p>
          This is the Bethesda Fountain, one of the many iconic attractions located in the heart of New York City’s Central Park that is visited by millions every year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The fountain was sculpted by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Stebbins"> Emma Stebbins</a> in the late 1800s. What’s striking about this, is that Stebbins was the first woman to be commissioned for public art in New York City, and her fountain was the only sculpture commissioned as part of Central Park’s original design. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The fountain is twenty-six feet high by ninety-six feet wide. The eight-foot bronze angel that rests above four smaller cherubs on the top of the fountain, is known as the <a href="https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/attractions/bethesda-fountain/#google_vignette"><span class="italic">Angel of The Waters</span></a>. She represents, “health, purity, temperance, and peace,” and was also said to have been inspired by a Bible passage,  showing an angel blessing a pool and giving it healing powers, “Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called... Bethesda... whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was also speculated that she modeled the angel after her partner, actress Charlotte Cushman, which is important to note that queer artists helped create the foundations of what is now NYC. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When living in New York City, it is easy to take history for granted. That’s not to say people aren’t interested. It’s more that people often settle into the busy city rhythm – and might not have time to research every plaque, building, statue,  historical landmark or fountain they come across.

        <h5>A Personal Meditation on The Fountain</h5>
        <p>
        It’s not just a pretty fountain. It was someone’s work, time and love. It’s a place I, like many others go to for solace. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After the 2024 presidential election, a friend and I sat silently at the fountain and were greeted by lots of other people using the park as an escape. A collective grief filled the air, that was both heavy and comforting. It was beautiful -- full of orange autumnal leaves and warm, but comfortable air. People ebbed and flowed around the fountain, watching the nearby boat rowers, geese and street performers, all enjoying the oasis that felt protected from the outside world. One musician particularly grabbed our attention. He was a large, but gentle looking man, wearing a ball cap and playing the accordion. His beautiful notes danced through the space, transporting all of us to what felt like the cobblestoned streets of France. He had a warmth that was only amplified when he saw a few toddlers approach him. He switched from his adult setlist to a more kid friendly one, playing classics like, <span class="italic">“The Wheels On The Bus.”</span> As the kids started dancing and laughing, he started up his bubble machine, bringing even more magic to his tiny audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way I can describe it was the exchange of joy. And it brought my hope back, which after the election was at a low. After feeling disappointed in what seemed like the lack of humanity in the United States, the feeling that so many people care more about themselves than the collective – I remembered that there are still good people. People who spend their time and energy making other people feel good, just because, like the bubble-accordian-man.
      </p>
      <p>
        This moment was so important to me, that a few weeks into the Trump presidency 2.0, feeling even worse than before, I needed to go back to this fountain. Although the experience was completely different – a cold and gray January day -- there were people. People enjoying the fountain, the park and each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t know how to get through the current political moment. I do know, however, that I am clinging to any and all opportunity to get to know the people and places around me. This fountain was one of them, and with six other fountains in Central Park and the greater New York City area to explore, I think I’ll be able to make it through.
