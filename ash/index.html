        It's Friday night at the Tiny Cupboard. It's a dreary, rainy day in nobody’s favorite month, January. But nestled inside a miniscule hole-in-the-wall, is a club full of warmth. More than anything, it's stuffed full of <i>people</i>.
      </p>
    </div>

  If it weren’t for the flickering neon sign, you’d likely walk right past the Tiny Cupboard, hardly noticing anything.

      <p>
        You enter –and exit– through the same cramped alleyway. Unused signs and furniture are stacked up wall to wall on either side of the walkway. If it weren’t such a dreary day, the stairs to the rooftop club might have been open, but today they are closed; leaving even less standing room for the growing alley crowd. The crowd flow comes to a total standstill as the 6:30 show makes room for the 8:30 show. 
      </p>

      <p>Once you finally break through the crowd of people, the bouncer takes a very haphazard glance at your ticket and your ID. If you’re taller than 5 '8” you’ll have to duck to get inside. Stepping in from the aquamarine glow of the entrance alley, guests are greeted with the pink floral wall of the main room. In true Bushwick fashion, the first thing you see is a Square Kiosk, manned by a 30-something with a mullet, facing you from the bar</p>

      <p>You order two drinks and the Cupboard’s signature popcorn. Your total is $38.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="module pullquote">
      The 30-something at the bar tells you he made it a combo so it would be "cheaper." You stare at him blankly, and accept your fate.
    </div>
    
    <div class="module bodycopy">
      <p>There are very few seats available. In true Brooklyn fashion, the space is so small that you might as well be riding the L train at rush hour. You sit down, knees touching with someone in skinny jeans wearing a scarf indoors. Through no fault of his, he is accidentally sitting on both his seat and yours. You squeeze in anyway.</p>

      <p>It almost feels inappropriate, how close you are sitting to the comedians. The “comics section” sign flickered into irrelevance at the 6:30 show from just how many people were inside. Every single table is full, with comedians embedded within the crowd. It’s impossible to tell who’s here to do standup and who’s just here to spend $13 on popcorn.</p>

      <p>
        The Chappell Roan playlist that has been playing the whole time sputters out as the host emerges from somewhere in the crowd and the show begins. In traditional comedy fashion, he asks some members of the crowd where they’re from. Two girls say they know each other from a small town.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="module pullquote">
        The host asks for the name of the small town.<br><br>

        “Savannah,” she replies. “Georgia.”<br><br>
        
        Only in New York is Savannah, Georgia a small town. 
      </div>

      <div class="module bodycopy">
        <p><strong>Do we have any crafters here?”</strong> one of the first comics, Kate Willet, asks the crowd.</p>

        <p><strong>About half of the room hollers back.</strong></p>

        <p>The comedy itself… is mostly good! For the most part, jokes land. Political comedy however is met with the cautious sighs and half-laughs of a crowd that is likely too aware of the current state of the world.</p>

        <p>The 8:30 show wraps up, and it only costs another arm and leg to stay for the 10:30 show. All you have to do is continue “supporting” the bar to enjoy the next show. Works out nicely that everything at the bar is about half of the price of the ticket required to get in.</p>

        <p>It’s unfortunate that none of the comics were able to integrate any of the ideas on the Tiny Cupboard’s unique feature: the joke suggestion board. Maybe on another night a comic would have been able to incorporate some of these genius ideas. Examples include: “Greenland”, “RFK Jr.” or “Booty Flakes.”</p>

        <p>It’s midnight when the show finally wraps up and the crowd shuffles out the tiny door from which they entered from, back into the dreary January night. Much like how they hung around in the crowd, the comics exit with you, off to their regular lives. </p>

        The M train grumbles above the exit as the pink neon sign flickers out, and The Tiny Cupboard disappears back into the crowded cityscape of Brooklyn. </div>
