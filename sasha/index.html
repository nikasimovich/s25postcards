        Toni stood before me lamenting the slow loss of the community she had come to love. Younger generations were no longer interested in dressing up to pretend they are in a bygone era. Small subculture groups had existed around the aesthetics of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s in most major cities since the 1970s. They gathered to swing dance at the Frim Fram Jam and jive at Otto’s. Now what was left was a room full of old heads watching it die.
        <p>
          <p> 
            I came with my cousin, we’d grown up in San Francisco, where you can still swing dance every night of the week, and she had recently moved to New York. We went in search of aesthetically reminiscent spaces; we found Otto’s Shrunken Head.

        Founded in 2002, Otto’s is an East Village classic. Its owners started it after several beloved tiki bars closed; Hawaii Kai, in Times Square, and Trader Vic’s, closed by Donald Trump in 1989. 
        <p>
        The American concept of the tiki bar emerged in the 1930s as a beloved part of American culture. It’s difficult to ignore the political and social context of this since the tiki bar means to aesthetically mimic romanticized versions of a meld of Pacific island cultures, Polynesia most commonly referenced, which therefore stereotypes the aesthetic and experience of islands in the Pacific Ocean as a whole. The bars died out in the 60s to then be reinvigorated in the 90s and then again in the late 2000s. 
      </p>
      It’s entirely possible that newer generations are rejecting the romanization of times and aesthetic reminiscent of oppression. It’s also possible that newer generations romanticization of retro styles only go so far, they are looking towards the 80s and 90s for fashion inspiration, not the 30s-60s as subcultures previous were prone to replicate. 
    </p>
    Despite problematic beginnings, the tiki bar has a long history of emotional escape. They seem to pop-up in larger numbers in times of economic recession and war. The newer bars seemed to romanticize the escapism of the 50s and 60s through immersion into a faux, kitsch, culture more than the romanization of the island cultures themselves. 
    </p>
    On Punk Rock Night, Otto’s is turned into a land of baby bangs and slick back hair. From the Elvis lookalikes, clad in leather jackets, to the cosplay 50s band geek. This particular night, just a week after inauguration day, those old and slightly less old gathered to drown their sorrows in decorative cocktails.
  </p>
  Susquehanna Industrial Tool and Die Co., a three man band dressed in head-to-toe vintage fashions, played with guest star Stella Rose Saint Clair, an online persona known for her vintage inspired looks. The band had been performing at Otto’s since at least 2012 and has been around since at least 2010, according to their Facebook.
</p>
The night carried a sense of escape. Between sets Tool and Die, as they are more colloquially known, made politically charged quips, things like, “raise your glass to the fall of America! We’ve seen it before,” spoke to the discontent and escapism present in the room. Everyone seemed to be thinking the same thing: with the robust history of the United States, how is it that we didn’t know better than to reelect an autocratic leader.

          There was joy here though, a celebration of the excitement and aesthetic value that seemed to go beyond political ruin and oppression. As people interested in vintage fashions have heard time and time again, celebrate vintage fashions not vintage values. Every time Stella Rose Saint Clair was brought to the stage they played a clip from A Streetcar Named Desire, specifically the sound bite that calls out for one of the characters in a grating sort of way, “Stella, Stelllaaaa,” it repeats as the room erupts in laughter and clapping. 
          <p>

              This space may not exist in the next ten years but for now Otto’s serves the people who need it, those who’ve seen as the political wheel has turned and are clinging on to what they believe still gives this country value, its ability to change.
