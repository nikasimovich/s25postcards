      On Tuesday evening, January 28th, 2025 at seven o’clock the most exclusive club in NYC- the Kit Kat club opened their doors. The line for the iconic August Wilson theater on W 52nd street wrapped sharply around the block. Phone cameras would be covered with a black sticker provided by the “bouncer,” only those that bought tickets would be allowed in and lead down a glowing green hallway to their designated seat.

      After leaving a show I am always left with a post show high. The excitement and thrill of a night of live entertainment has yet to wear off and the memory of talent still stings. Well aware of this phenomenon I face, I usually wait a few days before reviewing a show so I can recall the event with a clear mind. The show was guided by Emcee Adam Lambert, who did a stellar job. Lead role Sally Bowles was played by understudy Gabi Campo, instead of Auliʻi Cravalho, disappointing at first but Gabi did a fine job.

      Cabaret’s iconic track list stayed true while new choices updated the piece- like having the play take place in the round, audience members on every side inviting for as much participation from them as possible.

        Cabaret is a beautiful, intense, emotional and twisted classic play set in Berlin in the 1930s just before the rise of the Nazi regime. The story takes place in the Kit Kat club run by the Emcee who encourages the audience to escape reality through music, song and dance. The plot centers on Sally Bowles, a free-spirited British performer and her relationship with Clifford Bradshaw and American writer who has come to Berlin in search of inspiration. As their romance progresses so does the Nazi influence on those around them and the political and social issues begin to creep into their daily life forcing everyone to face the harsh reality of prejudice and authoritarianism.
