        <h5>An urban oasis tucked away from the hum of the city.</h5>
      <p>
      Walking through Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, a wave of quiet nature rushed over me. Resting trees stood still, their bare branches stretching toward the sky, while melting snow clung to the ground in patches. The crisp hush made every small sound more pronounced: the rustling of leaves in the wind, the soft chirping of birds, and the murmurs of a creak. I navigated my way toward the Steinhardt Conservatory, unhurried but determined; a rare corpse flower to see.

      <h5>As if I had walked through a portal to another time, another place. </h5>
      <p>
        Inside the conservatory, the atmosphere changed instantly. The air grew thick and tropical, wrapping around me like a warm embrace. Everything was green, lush, ancient, and alive. It was a stark contrast to the brittle winter outside.

      <h5>And then there was Smelliot.</h5>
      <p>
        Towering, alien, grotesque in its strange beauty. The Amorphophallus gigas, a corpse flower, affectionately named Smelliot,  exuded the unmistakable scent of decay; rotting flesh, the undeniable perfume of mortality. People of all ages gathered around, drawn in equal parts by curiosity and revulsion, compelled to experience this rare phenomenon firsthand. A flower native to Sumatra that blooms only once in years, for just a few days, and smells of death; yet here we were, together, marvelling at it.
        </p> 
        <hr>
         <h5>There was something deeply human about it all.</h5>
         <p>
          This hideous, magnificent plant had pulled strangers together, reminding us that nature, in all its forms, has a way of connecting us. Smelliot, in his brief, pungent bloom, was a reminder of lifeâ€™s fleeting moments, of beauty in the unexpected, of our shared curiosity at the core of who we are.
