      A poem I've read once goes like this:
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="italic">"She asks me to kill the spider.
Instead, I get the most
peaceful weapons I can find.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">I take a cup and a napkin.
I catch the spider, put it outside
and allow it to walk away.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">If I am ever caught in the wrong place
at the wrong time, just being alive
and not bothering anyone,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">I hope I am greeted
with the same kind
of mercy.”</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      - Rudy Francisco, <span class="italic">Mercy</span>

        This quaint exhibit, nestled between two bookshelves, showcased a collection of old and rare books, each providing insight on the origins of biological nomenclature—a universal system that honors each organism’s individuality by identifying and classifying their shared traits.

        <p>
        Biological nomenclature is a universal system that honors each organism’s individuality by identifying and classifying their shared traits—helping us to understand how species are classified, their evolutionary history, and their contributions towards biodiversity and our ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nomenclatures allow us to recognize and appreciate the uniqueness of each species. As we continue to explore evolution, biodiversity, and the roles within the ecosystem, this understanding becomes—especially for insects, who are facing a decline worldwide.

        <h5>A Quiet Bug's Life</h5>
        <p>
          Insects are fundamental to the health of our planet. From pollination to decomposition, each has their own important ecological role that contributes to biodiversity and sustains the delicate balance of life on Earth. By appreciating these tiny organisms, we acknowledge their roles in keeping our environment healthy and prosperous.

          While mantises and cockroaches may appear to be two separate species, they’re of the same taxonomy order—<span class="italic">Dictyoptera.</span> Cockroaches decompose decaying matter by breaking down organic waste; this process recycles nutrients, thus enriching the soil. Mantises are natural predators that help to control pest population, contributing to the balance of overall insect population and agricultural environments.

          Bee flies belong to the order <span class="italic">Diptera</span>, and within that order, they are classified under the family <span class="italic">Bombyliidae</span> While flies are often considered pests to humans, they are ecologically essential. As pollinators, they fertilize plants, contributing to the agricultural and ecological growth. Some flies act as decomposers, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients to enrich the soil, while others serve as natural pest controllers by parasitizing and preying on other harmful insects.
