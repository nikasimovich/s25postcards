    “What’s In a Name?”

    A delicate exhibit on the fourth floor of the Gottesman Research Library; a piece of the American Museum of Natural History.

    Encased in a beautiful concrete building, the exhibit examines the origin and importance of biological nomenclature amongst insects.

        On this rainy Friday afternoon, my visit to the insectarium was nothing short of a delight. Outside, the round curves of the building called to me from a distance. With each step closer, I bubbled with excitement. Inside, its liveliness echoed.  Soft, natural light from outside poured in through the windows. Warm light bulbs gently illuminate where the sunlight couldn’t reach. The space was perfectly balanced in attendance—not too crowded or overwhelming, but just enough to bring it to life.

        As I get older, I don’t know what to make of children. There’s a simplicity to them. They’re much more curious, and easily fascinated. The space was primarily made up of school children, accompanied by their guardians. Each child was immersed in the tiny creatures presented before them. Young boys wondering what it would be like to shrink down to the size of an insect and perhaps live among them. Children, completely captivated by the essence of such simple creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
        In that moment, I felt attuned to my environment, with a deep appreciation for what was truly before me. Insects, not as simple creatures, but as integral beings that live alongside us—each playing a crucial role in our ecology. Just as humans discriminate against certain races, discrimination of species also occurs, often associating insects with negative connotations. While butterflies are admired for their beauty and symbolic of freedom and hope, cockroaches are often deemed disgusting nuisances. Regardless, each insect contributes to the environment in its own unique way, and the loss of one species could lead to an ecological catastrophe.
