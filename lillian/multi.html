      We’re waiting for Grace to come out. I feel older in here than I did on the street; the people around me are all 15 with their sisters and dads and brothers. They’ve all got on skinny jeans and shirts much cooler than the ones I ever thought of wearing when I was 15. They don’t quite know what to do with their bodies in the room yet. They’re eager and anxious and waiting, just like me.

     I’ve never felt like we were supposed to live together or speak to one another or hold the same hands. My dad is 50 something and I try not to think about that, try not to think about what day the lights will turn off, try to drown in the music instead, memorize the lyrics, let him buy me tickets. I’m 15 and I'm standing awkwardly in front of a metal barrier next to the sister that hates me.

     I’m 21 and last night I listened to her hum these same melodies through my Marshall’s. Tonight, she’s passing them to me from the stage like a ball or a bean bag, and I never quite got that hand-eye coordination thing down when I was 15, but somehow, the notes still manage to land in my open palms.

I didn’t think I knew all the words, but I do, we all do, everyone in the room, even to the songs we’ve never heard before. We all have this thing that runs within us — between us — through us — this thing that might be magic or that might be something else.

The people in this room and I are all under attack, put at risk by the same something that might be magic or that might be something else, the same something that ties us together, the same something that hasn’t been taken from us yet but that could very well be soon.

    <div class="module bodycopy">
      <p>
    So what I’m saying is that I’m 21 and I’m seeing Grace Gardner at the Mercury Lounge on a Wednesday night after class. And what I’m saying is that I’ve listened to her music for months, but the lyrics sink deeper when she’s standing in front of me. I can feel the pain. I absorb it in an act of resistance. I hate the things that wait outside, the things that hold gavels and pens and power. I wish I could open myself and gather everyone between my organs, I wish I could keep everyone safe. 
      </p>
      <p>
    What I’m saying is that the people standing next to me and behind me and in front of me share something with me, something shimmering that eats us alive.
      </p>
      <p>
    I’m saying that we’re queer and alone in the city — but together in this room. 
      </p>
      <p>
     I’m saying that Grace stands in the booth outside of the room for twenty minutes after the show, waiting for all of us to come talk to her. And the corridor is so tight that we all smash into one body, and then this thing we all share carries us over and out toward the door. I see a father waiting for his daughter by the bar. I have to tell him that my dad used to do the same thing when I was 15, that he used to let me drag him to shows and play groupie for the night. I have to tell him that I am the way I am because of the way my father raised me. I have to tell him. I have to keep her safe.
      </p>
      <p>
     I’m saying that Grace gives me two hugs on my way out and tells me that the hurt of leaving safety behind will go away sometime.
      </p>
      <p>
     I’m saying that I built a time machine in the Lower East Side, and that me and all of my strangers climbed inside, and that we went somewhere else for a while, at least for the early show.
      </p>
