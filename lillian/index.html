      I’m 21 and I had a tense conversation with my friend’s friends before I got onto a train and pulled into a station and walked up the stairs and navigated my way to the venue and put on my mask and walked through the metal detector and found my sister and scanned my tickets and walked into the back of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
      I’m 21 and my sister is almost 23. We live down the street from one another and we work at the same place. She got me these tickets, mostly because she got me to tell her that I was lying all those years, got me to admit it to myself and our parents. I'm thinking of this night as a prize for coming clean.
      </p>
      <p>
      I’m 21, I’m at the Mercury Lounge, and we're waiting for Grace to come on stage. I feel older in here than I did on the street; the people around me are all 15 with their sisters and dads and brothers. They’ve all got on skinny jeans and shirts much cooler than the ones I ever thought of wearing when I was 15. They don’t quite know what to do with their bodies in the room yet, they’re eager and anxious and waiting, just like me. But I’ve got something to hold onto, my sister's hand in mine.
      </p>
      <p>
      I’m 21 but I’m wearing the same shoes I did when I was 15. When I look down at them in the silky blue light, suddenly my dad is rushing my sister and I out the door, into the car, down the highway, up the stairs, into the venue, to the stage, etc., etc. Suddenly I’m 15 with my hair just right and my jeans perfectly ripped, wearing a shirt that’s not quite cool enough. I’m 15 and my sister is 17 and I’ve never felt like we were supposed to live together or speak to one another or hold the same hands.
      </p>
       <p>
     I’m 15 and my dad is 50 something and I try not to think about that, try not to think about what day the lights will turn off, try to drown in the music instead, memorize the lyrics, let him buy me tickets and cart me down 422 and 476 until we get to the dive bar in Philly where I stand awkwardly in front of a metal barrier next to the sister that hates me.
      </p>
       <p>
    But then Grace comes out and I’m 21 again. I’m 21 and last night I listened to her hum these same melodies through my Marshall’s. Tonight, she’s passing them to me from the stage like a ball or a bean bag, and I never quite got that hand-eye coordination thing down when I was 15, but somehow, the notes still manage to land in my open palms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m 21 and I didn’t think I knew all the words, but I do, we all do, everyone in the room, even to the songs we’ve never heard before. We all have this thing that runs within us — between us — through us — this thing that might be magic or that might be something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m 21 and the people in this room and I are all under attack, all grieving the same something that might be magic or that might be something else, the same something that ties us together, the same something that hasn’t been taken from us yet but that could very well be soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what I’m saying is that I’m 21 and I’m seeing Grace Gardner at the Mercury Lounge on a Wednesday night after class. And what I’m saying is that I’ve listened to her music for months, but the lyrics sink deeper when she’s standing in front of me. I can feel the pain. I absorb it in an act of resistance. I hate the things that wait outside, the things that hold gavels and pens and power. What I’m saying is that the girls standing next to me and behind me and in front of me share something with me, something shimmering that eats us alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m saying that we’re queer and alone in the city, but together in this room, and that I don't have enough space in my bones or my words to keep us all safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m saying that Grace stands in the booth outside of the room for twenty minutes after the show, waiting for all of us to come talk to her. And the corridor is so tight that we all smash into one body, and this thing we all share carries us over and out toward the door. I see a father waiting for his daughter by the bar. I have to tell him that my dad used to do the same thing when I was 15, that he used to let me drag him to shows and play groupie for the night. I have to tell him that I am the way I am because of the way my father raised me. I have to tell him. I have to keep her safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m saying that Grace gives me two hugs on my way out and tells me that the hurt of leaving safety behind will go away sometime.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m saying that I built a time machine in the Lower East Side, and that me and all of my strangers climbed inside, and that we went somewhere else for a while, at least for the early show.
